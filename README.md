# 🚗 BMW Car Sales Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project applies **Machine Learning classification algorithms** to predict BMW car sales categories (e.g., *High* vs. *Low*) based on historical sales data.  
It is designed as a **hands-on end-to-end ML project** that demonstrates data preprocessing, multiple model training, evaluation, and comparison.
